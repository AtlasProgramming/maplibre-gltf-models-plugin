This is an example of how you can use the plugin architecture of MapLibre native to add significant functionality to the map engine without recompiling maplibre.

Since the functionality is currently in a PR in maplibre, a compiled binary version of the library is included in this project to get up and running quickly, but the plugin branch and PR is here: https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/pull/3430/ if you want to compile MapLibre from scratch and build your own version of the framework.
